** Credits
[[https://github.com/ChimeraCoder][Aditya Mukerjee]] I have been using his [[https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/duckduckbang][Firefox addon]] for some time and it gave me the idea for the buttons.
 I also used his code as a starting point for adding the buttons to the search result.
[[https://duckduckgo.com/][DuckDuckGo.com]] for icons, !bangs and their awesome search engine.

** Possible improvements
- Add custom buttons and links by providing a !bang and title.

- Custom sort links in context menu.
- Add buttons to other search engines like Google.
